            Handsome Badger brewing company is a Craft Brewery startup specializing in organic and sustainable brewing practices.  Along with high quality craft beer, HBB will have a partial kitchen for appetizers and small plates that patrons can enjoy while pairing with seasonal beer selections. 
            <br/>
            <br/>            
            Ken Jenkins and Russell Badgerow-Smith will own and operate HBB.  Ken is a professional brewer with a passion to create high quality beers. After receiving a bachelor's in biology, Ken attended the UC Davis Masters Brewing program and also earned his Diploma in Brewing from the Institute of Brewing and Distilling. Ken has experience brewing both ales and lagers from his employment as a brewer at both Rock Bottom Brewery and Gordon Biersch Brewery in San Jose, California.  Ken has also passed the IBD exam, which earned him the recognition and credentials to prove his ability to run a production facility. With Ken’s experience of brewing in the Silicon Valley, it helps him better understand what genre of beers are popular to the customer base.  His years of experience at two separate breweries, paired with his experience in the Silicon Valley, positions him well for opening and running the brewery.  Russell has spent several years working at various levels of management in the restaurant industry, gaining close personal knowledge of the integral aspects of a successful business. He took that knowledge into the construction of his current film production company. As a small business owner, Russell has come to intimately understand the finer points of meeting customer satisfaction and developing a product consumers want. As a craft beer enthusiast and avid homebrewer, Russell is passionate about establishing and maintaining a craft brewing company. His passion for beer alongside his experience working with company operations, makes Russell the ideal candidate to pursue a successful brewing company. In his previous employment, Russell concentrated on inventory management, labor optimization and production workflow. He worked closely with higher level management to design policies that advanced the company’s productivity and profit margins. With Russell directing day to day operations while conjointly supervising the marketing team and continually strategizing the expansion of HBB, the company’s profitability and market saturation will be increased.  With the individual backgrounds and extensive knowledge that Russell and Ken bring to the table, HBB will have a solid leadership team that will make it successful.
